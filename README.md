Project - proof of concept for league of legends/counter strike esports fantasy 

Introduction:
My friend group has played League of Legends (LoL) together for quite a long time now, and 
sometimes go into periods where we kind of pay attention to the professional scene. Additionally,
many of my friends enjoy following real-life sports (particularly basketball and football), and play
fantasy leagues (for the record, we are not gambling addicts. They play these for fun, and not for any
monetary rewards). 

One topic that occassionally comes up is that "we should do League of Legends fantasy". However, 
from what we can find, there is no good website out there that fits our needs, and we joke about
how our friend with a CS degree and developer job should make one. Since I have to create a website 
from scratch, it might as well be about this, so I can turn it into something that my friend group could
enjoy.

However, I am not too knowledgeable about professional League, nor how hypothetical League fantasy 
would work. With this limitation in mind, this "proof of conccept" is based on my experience with 
fantasy Counter-Strike (another video game), as implemented by the website HLTV. Under this system,
users create a fantasy team with a budget of $1,000,000. On average, players cost between $160,000 - $250,000,
depending on their in-game performance/statisitics. Players will gain/lose points based on their performance 
and the outcome (win/loss) of the game. Thus, a user must select a balanced team in order for their fantasy
team to perform well. (Example screenshots below)

However, a full implementation of a system such as this would be far out of scope of this project's 
requirements. Thus, this project will implement the functionality to create a fantasy team and edit it 
(similarly to an e-commerce website), as well as the functionality to search for other users and their teams.
